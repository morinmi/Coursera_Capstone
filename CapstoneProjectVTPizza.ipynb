    "Vermont is a state well known for its green mountains, ski resorts, colorful foliage, and landscapes.  It's also famous for its cheddar cheese, maple syrup, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream.  While its pizza is not as famous as New York or Chicago - there are many chain and local pizza restaurants in the major cities and towns.  I was born and raised in rural Vermont, moved to the Burlington area in 1996 and have lived in several of the largest cities/towns in the state since then.\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to investigate the existing restaurants and bars in Vermont - How many are there?  Where are they?  Is there one or a few general areas where businesses (specifically restaurants) seem to thrive?  Are the pizza restaurants evenly distributed?  Is there a heavily populated area where it appears a new pizza restaurant would succeed?\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Target Audience__ for this investigation would be any current restaurant owner who wants to understand more about his competition or a prospective entrepeneur who wants to open a new pizza restaurant."
